## Abstract

As part of our final group project, students shall implement a neural network to gain a better understanding of machine learning in practice. To achieve our goal, we try to get the best possible accuracy. To fully understand this dataset and the classification problem, we provided a detailed description of task and its issues. For having a broader understanding of what research contributes to this task of image recognition, we introduce a summary of the latest publications and developments around the image classification field. For our implementation we decided to use a VGG16 model architecture. We go into detail about our model architecture and explain all of its components and corresponding layers. In the end, we analyse the results of our training process and compare it with similar implementation and the state-of-the-art models. 

## Content

- Python Notebook as [iPython](https://github.com/bohniti/cifar-10/blob/master/CS4487_Group_Project_CIFAR10.ipynb) 
- Report/Paper as [PDF](https://github.com/bohniti/cifar-10/blob/master/Paper.pdf)

## Getting Started

Clone the repository, to get our Notebooks and Project Report.

```
git clone https://github.com/bohniti/cifar-10.git
```

### Prerequisites

- You need git to get the source
- If you want to compile the report by yourself you need a LaTex Compiler for your OS and an IDE which makes things easier
- If you want to compile, train and play with our Code you need a python working environment. We used Jupyter Notebooks. The requiered packeges you can see in the Notebooks itself.

### Run the Notebook

```
cd/you_cloned_repo_location jupyter notebook
```

### Deployment

Just pull the repo, if you wanna change sth you can ask :)
